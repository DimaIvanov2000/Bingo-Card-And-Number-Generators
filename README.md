# Bingo Card & Number Generators

Two programs designed to generate Bingo cards in a text file and to randomly draw numbers for Bingo.

## How to Run

Download the file and / or run the code on your IDE of choice (Codeblocks or DevC++ should both work). The card generator will simply create a text file while the number generator appears as a console window.

## How to Use

Five cards are generated at a time, each 5x5 with a free space in the middle and featuring numbers 1-99 without repeats. The number generator generates a number with almost any key press and resets automatically once all possible numbers have been generated. It can also be restarted using the escape key.
